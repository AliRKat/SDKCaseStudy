README

Dear reviewers, hello!

Thanks for spending your time reviewing this test case.

Please start with the Assets/ExampleGame/Scenes/Load scene.
It is essential for the SDK to be initialized correctly.

I’ve included XML summaries for methods I felt required documentation. If anything looks odd or suspicious, feel free to reach out — I’ll be happy to clarify.

All design-related material is in the Design folder, including:

Design Notes

Class Diagram

Sequence Diagram

Lastly, just to note: I’ve been on a pretty packed schedule and ended up working through late nights to put this together. I hope the effort shows — and that you enjoy going through it as much as I (painfully) enjoyed making it.
